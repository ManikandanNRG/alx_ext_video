# Task 3: Increase Polling Time - COMPLETED ✅

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Time Taken:** 10 minutes  
**Risk Level:** Very Low  

---

## What Was Changed:

### File: `amd/src/uploader.js` (Line 370)

**Before:**
```javascript
const delays = [3000, 5000, 7000, 10000, 15000]; // Total: ~40 seconds
```

**After:**
```javascript
const delays = [5000, 10000, 15000, 15000, 15000]; // Total: 60 seconds
```

### File: `amd/build/uploader.min.js`
- ✅ Rebuilt with updated timing values

---

## What This Improves:

### Old Timing (40 seconds total):
```
Attempt 1: Wait 3s  → Check → Total elapsed: 3s
Attempt 2: Wait 5s  → Check → Total elapsed: 8s
Attempt 3: Wait 7s  → Check → Total elapsed: 15s
Attempt 4: Wait 10s → Check → Total elapsed: 25s
Attempt 5: Wait 15s → Check → Total elapsed: 40s
```

### New Timing (60 seconds total):
```
Attempt 1: Wait 5s  → Check → Total elapsed: 5s   (quick check for small files)
Attempt 2: Wait 10s → Check → Total elapsed: 15s
Attempt 3: Wait 15s → Check → Total elapsed: 30s
Attempt 4: Wait 15s → Check → Total elapsed: 45s
Attempt 5: Wait 15s → Check → Total elapsed: 60s
```

## Benefits:

1. ✅ **More videos marked as "ready"** during initial upload
2. ✅ **Fewer videos stuck in "uploading" status**
3. ✅ **Better for medium-sized files** (100-500 MB)
4. ✅ **No breaking changes** - just extends wait time
5. ✅ **Progressive timing** - starts fast, waits longer for large files

---

## Testing Instructions:

### Test 1: Small File (< 100 MB)
1. Upload a small video file
2. Watch the progress bar
3. Should show "Processing video... (1/5)", "(2/5)", etc.
4. Should complete within 5-15 seconds if video processes quickly

### Test 2: Medium File (100-500 MB)
1. Upload a medium video file
2. Watch the status checks
3. Should wait up to 60 seconds checking status
4. More likely to be marked "ready" instead of "uploading"

### Test 3: Large File (> 500 MB)
1. Upload a large video file
2. Watch the status checks
3. May still show "uploading" after 60 seconds (expected)
4. User can refresh page to check status (Task 4 will fix this)

---

## Expected User Experience:

**Before:**
- Upload completes
- Checks status for 40 seconds
- If not ready → Shows "Uploading" status
- User must refresh page

**After:**
- Upload completes
- Checks status for 60 seconds (50% more time)
- More videos become "ready" during this time
- Fewer videos stuck as "uploading"

---

## No Breaking Changes:

- ✅ Same number of attempts (5)
- ✅ Same logic flow
- ✅ Same API calls
- ✅ Only timing values changed
- ✅ Backward compatible

---

## Next Steps:

This task is complete and ready for testing. Recommended next tasks:

1. **Task 1** (15 min) - Add file format info
2. **Task 6** (15 min) - Add processing message
3. **Task 2** (25 min) - Improve status messages
4. **Task 4** (30 min) - Fix stuck videos on refresh (CRITICAL)

---

## Rollback Instructions (if needed):

If you need to revert this change:

1. Edit `amd/src/uploader.js` line 370
2. Change back to: `const delays = [3000, 5000, 7000, 10000, 15000];`
3. Rebuild: Copy to `amd/build/uploader.min.js`
4. Clear Moodle cache

**Task 3 Status: ✅ COMPLETED**  
**Ready for Production: ✅ YES**  
**Requires Testing: ✅ YES (but low risk)**
