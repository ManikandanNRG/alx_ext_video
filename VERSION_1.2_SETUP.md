# Version 1.2 Setup Guide

## Quick Start Commands

### 1. Tag Current Stable Version (v1.1.0)

```bash
# Make sure you're on main branch with latest changes
git checkout main
git pull

# Tag the current stable version
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Version 1.1.0 - Stable direct upload implementation

Features:
- Direct upload up to 200MB
- Video playback with signed URLs
- Automatic cleanup system
- Rate limiting
- GDPR compliance
- Grading interface integration
- Security audit completed"

# Push the tag
git push origin v1.1.0

# Verify tag was created
git tag -l
git show v1.1.0
```

### 2. Create Feature Branch for v1.2

```bash
# Create new branch from main
git checkout -b feature/tus-upload-v1.2

# Verify you're on the new branch
git branch
# Should show: * feature/tus-upload-v1.2

# Push branch to remote
git push -u origin feature/tus-upload-v1.2
```

### 3. Update Version File

The version.php file needs to be updated to reflect v1.2.0-dev:

```php
<?php
// This file is part of Moodle - http://moodle.org/

defined('MOODLE_INTERNAL') || die();

$plugin = new stdClass();
$plugin->version   = 2025110101;        // The current plugin version (Date: YYYYMMDDXX)
$plugin->requires  = 2022112800;        // Requires Moodle 4.1 or higher
$plugin->component = 'assignsubmission_cloudflarestream';
$plugin->maturity  = MATURITY_BETA;     // Changed to BETA for development
$plugin->release   = '1.2.0-dev';       // Development version
$plugin->dependencies = array();
```

**Changes**:
- `version`: 2025110101 (today's date + 01)
- `maturity`: MATURITY_BETA (was MATURITY_STABLE)
- `release`: '1.2.0-dev' (was '1.0.1')

### 4. Commit Version Change

```bash
# Stage the version file
git add mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/version.php

# Commit with clear message
git commit -m "chore: Bump version to 1.2.0-dev for TUS upload feature

- Changed version to 2025110101
- Set maturity to BETA for development
- Updated release to 1.2.0-dev
- Starting TUS resumable upload implementation"

# Push to remote
git push
```

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development

```bash

git checkout feature/tus-upload-v1.2
git pull

# Make changes
# ... implement TUS features ...

# Commit frequently
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add TUS session creation method"

git checkout feature/tus-upload-v1.2
# Now you have the TUS upload development version
```

### Testing Both Versions

```bash
# Test stable version
git checkout main
# Deploy to test server
# Test direct upload (up to 200MB)

# Test development version
git checkout feature/tus-upload-v1.2
# Deploy to dev server
# Test TUS upload (up to 30GB)
```
