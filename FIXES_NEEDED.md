## Files That Need to Be Uploaded to Server

1. **mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/lib.php** - Fixed syntax error and added parent class require
2. **mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/db/install.xml** - Fixed table name length
3. **mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/lang/en/assignsubmission_cloudflarestream.php** - Added missing language strings

## Steps to Complete Installation

1. **Upload the 3 fixed files above** to your server (replace existing files)

2. **Clear Moodle cache**:
   ```
   Site Administration ‚Üí Development ‚Üí Purge all caches
   ```

3. **Verify plugin is enabled**:
   ```
   Site Administration ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Activity modules ‚Üí Assignment ‚Üí Submission plugins
   ‚Üí Manage assignment submission plugins
   ```
   Ensure "Cloudflare Stream video submission" is enabled (eye icon should be open/green)

4. **Configure plugin settings**:
   ```
   Site Administration ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Activity modules ‚Üí Assignment ‚Üí Submission plugins
   ‚Üí Cloudflare Stream video submission ‚Üí Settings
   ```
   Enter:
   - Cloudflare API Token
   - Cloudflare Account ID
   - Video Retention Period (default: 90 days)
   - Maximum File Size (default: 5 GB)

5. **Test the plugin**:
   - Create a new assignment
   - In assignment settings, scroll to "Submission types"
   - You should now see "Cloudflare Stream video submission" as an option
   - Enable it and save the assignment
   - Test uploading a video as a student

## Known Issues

### Dashboard and Video Management Pages
The dashboard.php and videomanagement.php pages may show "section error" because they are standalone admin pages that need proper Moodle context setup. These are optional admin tools and don't affect the core functionality of video uploads and playback.

**Workaround**: These pages can be accessed directly but may need additional fixes for proper integration with Moodle's admin menu system.

## Core Functionality Status

‚úÖ **Working**:
- Plugin installation
- Database schema creation
- Plugin appears in admin menu
- Settings page
- Language strings

‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Testing**:
- Video upload interface in assignments
- Video playback in grading interface
- Cloudflare API integration
- Dashboard and video management pages

üîß **Next Steps**:
1. Upload the 3 fixed files
2. Clear cache
3. Configure Cloudflare credentials
4. Test video upload and playback
5. Report any remaining issues

## If Plugin Still Doesn't Show in Assignment Submission Types

This could be due to:
1. Cache not cleared properly
2. Plugin not properly enabled
3. Missing capability definitions

**Debug steps**:
```bash
# On server, check if plugin is registered
cd /var/www/html
php admin/cli/uninstall_plugins.php --show-all | grep cloudflarestream

# Check for PHP errors
sudo tail -100 /var/log/apache2/error.log | grep cloudflarestream
```

## Summary

The plugin had 4 critical issues that prevented it from working:
1. PHP syntax error
2. Missing parent class
3. Database table name too long
4. Missing language strings

All issues have been fixed. Upload the 3 files, clear cache, and the plugin should work.
