# GDPR Privacy Provider Tests - Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive unit tests for GDPR compliance in the S3 Video submission plugin.

## Test File
`mod/assign/submission/s3video/tests/privacy_provider_test.php`

## Tests Implemented

### 1. Metadata Tests
- **test_get_metadata()**: Verifies that the privacy provider correctly declares all personal data tables and external locations (AWS S3)

### 2. Data Export Tests
- **test_export_user_data()**: Tests that user data is correctly exported in GDPR-compliant format
  - Exports video submission data (S3 keys, file sizes, upload timestamps, etc.)
  - Exports activity log data (upload events, playback events, errors)
  - Verifies data formatting and completeness

- **test_export_user_data_no_data()**: Tests export when user has no data (should return empty)

### 3. Context Discovery Tests
- **test_get_contexts_for_userid()**: Tests finding all contexts where a user has video data
  - Verifies correct module contexts are returned
  - Tests with multiple users

- **test_get_contexts_for_userid_no_data()**: Tests context discovery when user has no data

### 4. User Discovery Tests
- **test_get_users_in_context()**: Tests finding all users with data in a specific context
  - Verifies all users with video submissions are found
  - Verifies all users with log entries are found

- **test_get_users_in_context_no_data()**: Tests user discovery in empty context

### 5. Data Deletion Tests

#### Single User Deletion
- **test_delete_data_for_user()**: Tests deleting data for a specific user
  - Verifies video records are marked as 'deleted' in database
  - Verifies deleted_timestamp is set
  - Verifies log entries are removed
  - Verifies other users' data is NOT affected
  - Tests S3 deletion (when credentials available)

#### Multiple Users Deletion
- **test_delete_data_for_users()**: Tests deleting data for multiple users at once
  - Verifies all specified users' videos are marked as deleted
  - Verifies all specified users' logs are removed
  - Tests bulk deletion operations

#### Context-wide Deletion
- **test_delete_data_for_all_users_in_context()**: Tests deleting all data in a context
  - Verifies all videos in the assignment are marked as deleted
  - Verifies all logs for the assignment are removed
  - Tests complete context cleanup

### 6. Error Handling Tests
- **test_delete_with_api_failure()**: Tests graceful handling when AWS API is unavailable
  - Verifies deletion continues even without AWS credentials
  - Verifies database records are still marked as deleted
  - Ensures GDPR compliance even when S3 deletion fails

## Test Data Structure

Each test creates realistic test data:
- Course with assignment
- Multiple students and teachers
- Video submissions with metadata (S3 keys, file sizes, durations)
- Activity logs (upload events, playback events)

## Key Features Tested

### Data Export
✅ Video submission metadata exported correctly
✅ Activity logs exported correctly
✅ Data formatted with human-readable values (file sizes, durations)
✅ Timestamps converted to readable format
✅ Empty exports handled gracefully

### Data Deletion
✅ Videos marked as deleted in database
✅ Deleted timestamp recorded
✅ S3 objects deleted (when credentials available)
✅ CloudFront cache invalidated (when configured)
✅ Log entries completely removed
✅ Other users' data preserved
✅ Graceful handling of API failures

### GDPR Compliance
✅ Right to access (data export)
✅ Right to erasure (data deletion)
✅ Right to data portability (structured export)
✅ Privacy by design (external data documented)
✅ Graceful degradation (works without AWS access)

## Running the Tests

### Using Moodle PHPUnit
```bash
# Initialize PHPUnit (first time only)
php admin/tool/phpunit/cli/init.php

# Run all privacy tests
vendor/bin/phpunit --filter privacy_provider_test

# Run specific test
vendor/bin/phpunit --filter test_export_user_data mod/assign/submission/s3video/tests/privacy_provider_test.php
```

### Test Coverage
- **10 test methods** covering all GDPR requirements
- Tests both success and failure scenarios
- Tests with and without data
- Tests single and bulk operations

## Requirements Covered
- **Requirement 5.2**: Video metadata tracking and GDPR compliance
- All privacy provider methods tested
- All deletion scenarios covered
- Export functionality verified

## Notes
- Tests use Moodle's `provider_testcase` base class
- Tests reset database after each test (`resetAfterTest()`)
- Tests mock AWS credentials to avoid real API calls
- Tests verify database state changes
- Tests ensure data isolation between users
