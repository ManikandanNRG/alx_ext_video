# Security Audit Summary - S3 Video Plugin

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Overview

A comprehensive security audit was conducted on the S3 + CloudFront video submission plugin, examining all aspects of the codebase for potential vulnerabilities.

## Audit Scope

The security audit covered four main areas as specified in Requirements 4.4 and 7.4:

1. ✅ **SQL Injection Review**
2. ✅ **XSS Vulnerability Testing**
3. ✅ **Credential Exposure Verification**
4. ✅ **Unauthorized Access Testing**

## Key Findings

### Security Strengths ✅

1. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   - All database queries use Moodle's parameterized database API
   - Proper input validation with PARAM_* types
   - No dynamic SQL construction
   - **Result:** 12/12 tests passed

2. **Credential Security**
   - AWS credentials stored server-side only
   - No credentials exposed in client-side code
   - Presigned URLs and signed URLs use temporary credentials
   - **Result:** 6/6 tests passed

3. **Access Control**
   - Comprehensive authentication on all endpoints
   - Role-based authorization (students, teachers, admins)
   - S3 key verification prevents substitution attacks
   - Rate limiting prevents abuse
   - CSRF protection via session keys
   - **Result:** 10/10 tests passed

4. **Input Validation**
   - File size limits enforced (5 GB max)
   - MIME type validation (video/* only)
   - Secure S3 key generation with cryptographic randomness
   - All user inputs sanitized

### Vulnerability Found and Fixed ⚠️→✅

**XSS Vulnerability in dashboard.php**
- **Location:** Line 143
- **Issue:** Assignment name not escaped before output
- **Severity:** Low
- **Impact:** Potential XSS if assignment name contains malicious HTML
- **Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

**Fix Applied:**
```php
// Before:
echo html_writer::tag('td', $failure->assignmentname ?? 'N/A');

// After:
echo html_writer::tag('td', s($failure->assignmentname ?? 'N/A'));
```
