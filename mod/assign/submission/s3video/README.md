- **S3 Storage**: $0.023 per GB/month
- **S3 Requests**: $0.005 per 1,000 PUT requests
- **CloudFront Data Transfer**: $0.085 per GB
- **CloudFront Requests**: $0.0075 per 10,000 requests

### Example Scenarios

**Small Course (50 students, 500 MB videos each)**
- Storage: 25 GB Ã— $0.023 = $0.58/month
- Upload: 50 Ã— $0.000005 = $0.0003
- Playback (1 view each): 25 GB Ã— $0.085 = $2.13
- **Total: ~$2.71/month**

**Large Course (500 students, 1 GB videos each)**
- Storage: 500 GB Ã— $0.023 = $11.50/month
- Upload: 500 Ã— $0.000005 = $0.003
- Playback (2 views each): 1000 GB Ã— $0.085 = $85
- **Total: ~$96.50/month**

### AWS Free Tier (First 12 Months)

- **S3**: 5 GB storage, 20,000 GET requests, 2,000 PUT requests
- **CloudFront**: 50 GB data transfer, 2,000,000 requests
- **Ideal for**: Testing and small deployments

### Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Set Retention Period**: Delete old videos automatically
2. **Compress Videos**: Encourage students to compress before upload
3. **Limit File Size**: Set lower limits if 5 GB isn't needed
4. **Monitor Usage**: Check dashboard regularly
5. **Use Free Tier**: Test thoroughly before scaling

## Security

### Data Protection

- Videos stored in private S3 bucket (not publicly accessible)
- CloudFront signed URLs expire after 24 hours
- AWS credentials encrypted in Moodle database
- All communication over HTTPS

### Access Control

- Students can only upload to their own submissions
- Teachers can only view submissions in their courses
- Administrators can view all submissions
- Moodle's role-based permissions enforced

### Best Practices

1. **Rotate Credentials**: Change AWS credentials periodically
2. **Monitor Access**: Review CloudFront access logs
3. **Limit Permissions**: IAM user has minimal required permissions
4. **Secure Private Key**: Store CloudFront private key securely
5. **Update Regularly**: Keep Moodle and plugin updated
