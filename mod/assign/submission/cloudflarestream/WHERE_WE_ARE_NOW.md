## ❓ What's NOT Working

### Issue: Video Not Playing

**Symptoms:**
- No console output when viewing video

**Possible causes:**
1. JavaScript not loading
2. Player not being initialized
3. Token generation failing
4. Browser cache not cleared
5. Wrong page being viewed

---

## 🔍 Next Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Test Token Generation

**Run this:**
```
https://dev.aktrea.net/mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/test_token_simple.php
```

**This will:**
- Generate a token for your video (23b7a0e3b30068adbaa0692cc1b10724)
- Show the token details
- Display the video in an IFRAME
- Tell us if token generation is working

**Expected result:**
- ✅ Token generated successfully
- ✅ Video plays in the IFRAME

**If video doesn't play:**
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Check Network tab for 401 errors

### Step 2: Check Actual Submission Page

**Where are you viewing the video?**
- Assignment submission page?
- Dashboard?
- Test page?

**Please:**
1. Go to the actual assignment submission page
2. View your submission with the video
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Take screenshot of:
   - The page
   - Console tab
   - Network tab (filter: XHR)

### Step 3: Check JavaScript Loading

**In browser console, type:**
```javascript
require(['assignsubmission_cloudflarestream/player'], function(player) {
    console.log('Player loaded:', player);
});
```

**Expected:** Should show "Player loaded: Object"

**If error:** JavaScript module not loading
