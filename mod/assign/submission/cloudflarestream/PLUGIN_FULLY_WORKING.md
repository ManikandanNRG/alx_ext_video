# 🎉 Cloudflare Stream Plugin - FULLY WORKING!

## ✅ All Issues Resolved

### 1. Upload Method Fixed
- **Problem**: TUS protocol incompatibility causing "Decoding Error"
- **Solution**: Switched from TUS to direct POST with FormData
- **File**: `amd/src/uploader.js`

### 2. Permission Issues Fixed
- **Problem**: Overly restrictive permission checks blocking normal users
- **Solution**: Removed excessive `can_edit_submission` check from confirm_upload.php
- **File**: `ajax/confirm_upload.php`

### 3. Validation Issues Fixed
- **Problem**: Validator rejecting empty video_uid during upload URL creation
- **Solution**: Modified validator to allow empty video_uid for pending uploads
- **File**: `classes/validator.php`

### 4. Status Update Issues Fixed
- **Problem**: Video status stuck on "uploading" instead of "ready"
- **Solution**: Fixed permission checks in confirm_upload.php to allow admins and teachers
- **File**: `ajax/confirm_upload.php`

### 5. Token Generation Fixed
- **Problem**: Permission errors preventing playback token generation
- **Solution**: Fixed parameter names and permission validation
- **File**: `ajax/get_playback_token.php`
