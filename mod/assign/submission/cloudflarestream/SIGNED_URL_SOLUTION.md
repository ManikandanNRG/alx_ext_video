# Cloudflare Stream Signed URL Solution

## Problem
Private videos (requireSignedURLs: true) with Cloudflare Stream are not playing despite:
- Token generation working
- Stream SDK loading
- Player object created

## Root Cause
The `Stream()` constructor with signed tokens doesn't work reliably. The SDK doesn't create the iframe/stream element properly.

## Solution: Use the Working Video First

Test with video UID `103366d38ef2bd1ea4b02e6ec6e0dcde` which was confirmed working in test_video_playback.php.

## Steps:

1. Make that video private:
```

```

2. Test with the working player code from test_video_playback.php

3. Once working, apply the same approach to player.js

## The Working Approach (from test_video_playback.php):

```javascript
// Load SDK
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = 'https://embed.cloudflarestream.com/embed/sdk.latest.js';
script.onload = function() {
    // Create <stream> element
    const container = document.getElementById('stream-player');
    container.innerHTML = '<stream src="VIDEO_UID" controls preload="metadata"></stream>';
    
    // Set token on the element
    setTimeout(function() {
        const streamElement = container.querySelector('stream');
        streamElement.token = playbackToken;
    }, 100);
};
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

This is the method that was working before.
