# Backup Information

**Created:** 2025-10-29
**Purpose:** Backup of working PUBLIC video implementation before implementing PRIVATE video support

## Backed Up Files

### 1. player.js.backup
- **Original:** `amd/src/player.js`
- **Status:** Working with PUBLIC videos (requireSignedURLs: false)
- **Method:** Uses `<stream src="TOKEN">` element
- **Issue:** Doesn't work with PRIVATE videos

### 2. cloudflare_client.php.backup
- **Original:** `classes/api/cloudflare_client.php`
- **Line 131:** `'requireSignedURLs' => false` (PUBLIC videos)
- **Status:** Working perfectly for public video uploads

## How to Restore

If the new PRIVATE video implementation fails:

```bash
# Restore player.js
copy mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/backups/player.js.backup mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/amd/src/player.js

# Restore cloudflare_client.php
copy mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/backups/cloudflare_client.php.backup mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/classes/api/cloudflare_client.php

# Rebuild JavaScript
cd mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream
npx grunt amd
```

## What Was Working

âœ… Video upload to Cloudflare (as PUBLIC)
âœ… Status tracking and polling
âœ… Database storage
âœ… Public video playback
âœ… Access control and permissions
âœ… Error handling

## What We're Implementing

ðŸ”§ IFRAME-based player for PRIVATE videos
ðŸ”§ Change upload to requireSignedURLs: true
ðŸ”§ Proper signed token usage in IFRAME src
