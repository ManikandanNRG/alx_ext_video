# Large File Upload Optimizations Applied

## âœ… Changes Made for Large File Support (100MB - 1GB+)

### 1. Upload Settings Optimized
- **Chunk Size**: Increased to 50MB (was default ~5MB)
- **Upload Duration**: Extended to 12 hours (was 6 hours)
- **Retry Delays**: Extended to [0, 1000, 3000, 5000, 10000, 15000]
- **File Size Limit**: 5GB maximum supported

### 2. Error Handling Improved
- Better timeout error messages
- Network error detection
- Detailed progress logging (shows MB uploaded)
- Graceful retry mechanism

### 3. Files Modified
- `amd/src/uploader.js` - Main upload logic
- `amd/build/uploader.min.js` - Compiled version (updated)
- `ajax/get_upload_url.php` - Extended upload duration
- `classes/api/cloudflare_client.php` - Public videos by default

## ðŸ§ª How to Test with Real User

### Step 1: Assign to User
1. Create/edit an assignment
2. Enable "Cloudflare Stream Video" submission type
3. Assign to a test user (not admin)

### Step 2: Test Upload as User
1. Login as the test user
2. Go to the assignment
3. Try uploading a large file (143MB+)
4. Monitor browser console for progress logs

### Step 3: Check Results
- Upload should show detailed progress: "Upload progress: 50MB / 143MB (35%)"
- Should handle network interruptions with retries
- Should complete successfully and show "ready" status

## ðŸ”§ If Still Having Issues

### Check Browser Console
Look for these messages:
- `Upload progress: XMB / YMB (Z%)` - Shows it's working
- `Upload error: timeout` - Network/server timeout
- `Upload error: network` - Connection issues

### Server-Side Checks
1. Check Apache error logs for PHP timeouts
2. Verify Cloudflare Stream account limits
3. Check network bandwidth between server and Cloudflare

### Possible Additional Optimizations
If 143MB still fails:
1. Increase chunk size to 100MB
2. Add connection quality detection
3. Implement pause/resume functionality

## ðŸ“Š Expected Performance
- **Small files (< 50MB)**: Should upload quickly
- **Medium files (50-500MB)**: 2-10 minutes depending on connection
- **Large files (500MB-1GB)**: 10-30 minutes, but should complete reliably

The optimizations prioritize **reliability over speed** for large files.
