   - Wait for processing

2. **View the video:**
   - View your submission
   - Video should play in IFRAME

3. **Check browser console (F12):**
   ```
   Cloudflare player embedded with IFRAME method
   Video UID: [32-char string]
   Token length: [500+ chars]
   ```

4. **Inspect video element:**
   - Right-click on video
   - Inspect element
   - Should see:
   ```html
   <iframe src="https://iframe.videodelivery.net/VIDEO_UID?token=eyJhbGc...">
