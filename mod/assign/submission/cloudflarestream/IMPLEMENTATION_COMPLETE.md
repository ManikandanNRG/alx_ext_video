## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### Private Video Support with IFRAME Method

Videos are now uploaded as **PRIVATE** and require **signed tokens** for playback using the **IFRAME method** as recommended by Cloudflare documentation.

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. Upload Configuration
**File:** `classes/api/cloudflare_client.php`  
**Line:** 131  
**Change:** `requireSignedURLs: false` → `requireSignedURLs: true`

```php
// BEFORE
'requireSignedURLs' => false  // Public videos

// AFTER
'requireSignedURLs' => true  // Private videos
```

### 2. Player Implementation
**File:** `amd/src/player.js`  
**Method:** `embedPlayer()`  
**Change:** `<stream>` element → IFRAME with token parameter

```javascript
// BEFORE (didn't work for private videos)
const streamElement = $('<stream>')
    .attr('src', this.token);

// AFTER (correct IFRAME method)
const iframeUrl = `https://iframe.videodelivery.net/${this.videoUid}?token=${this.token}`;
const iframe = $('<iframe>')
    .attr('src', iframeUrl)
    .attr('allowfullscreen', true);
```

### 3. Token Refresh
**File:** `amd/src/player.js`  
**Method:** `refreshToken()`  
**Change:** Updated to refresh IFRAME src with new token

```javascript
// Update iframe src with new token
const newUrl = `https://iframe.videodelivery.net/${this.videoUid}?token=${this.token}`;
$(this.playerIframe).attr('src', newUrl);
```

### 4. Build Files
**File:** `amd/build/player.min.js`  
**Status:** ✅ Rebuilt with new code
