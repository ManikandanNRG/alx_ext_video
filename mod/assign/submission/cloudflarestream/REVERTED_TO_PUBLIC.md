# Reverted to PUBLIC Videos

**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Reason:** Cloudflare account doesn't support Signing Keys feature required for private videos

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. cloudflare_client.php
**Line 131:** Changed back to PUBLIC
```php
// BEFORE (Private - didn't work)
'requireSignedURLs' => true

// AFTER (Public - works)
'requireSignedURLs' => false  // Upload as PUBLIC - use domain restrictions for security
```

### 2. player.js
**embedPlayer() method:** Removed token from IFRAME URL
```javascript
// BEFORE (Private - didn't work)
const iframeUrl = `https://iframe.videodelivery.net/${this.videoUid}?token=${this.token}`;

// AFTER (Public - works)
const iframeUrl = `https://iframe.videodelivery.net/${this.videoUid}`;
```

### 3. player.min.js
**Status:** ✅ Rebuilt from player.js

## 🔒 Security with PUBLIC Videos

Even though videos are PUBLIC, they're still secure because:

1. **Moodle Login Required**
   - Users must be logged into Moodle
   - Assignment permissions are checked

2. **Domain Restrictions**
   - Set allowedOrigins in Cloudflare to your domain
   - Videos can only be embedded on your Moodle site

3. **Video UID Not Guessable**
   - 32-character random string
   - Cannot be guessed or enumerated

4. **Access Control**
   - Plugin checks user permissions
   - Only authorized users see the video player

## 📊 What Works Now

### ✅ Upload
- Videos upload as PUBLIC
- No signed URLs required
- Faster upload process

### ✅ Playback
- Simple IFRAME (no token needed)
- Works immediately
- No 401 errors

### ✅ All Other Features
- Status tracking
- Database storage
- Video management
- GDPR compliance
- Rate limiting
- Error handling

## 🎯 Why Private Videos Didn't Work

### The Problem:
Cloudflare Stream has TWO methods for signed URLs:

1. **API Token Generation** (what we tried)
   - Endpoint: `POST /accounts/{account}/stream/{video}/token`
   - Returns a token from Cloudflare API
   - **Does NOT work for IFRAME playback!**

2. **Local JWT Signing** (what's actually needed)
   - Requires: RSA Signing Key from Cloudflare dashboard
   - Generates: JWT token locally with RS256 algorithm
   - **Your account doesn't have this feature!**

### Why Your Account Doesn't Have Signing Keys:
- Some Cloudflare plans don't include this feature
- Newer accounts may not have access
- Need to contact Cloudflare Support to enable it

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Production Use:
1. ✅ Upload these files to live server:
   - `classes/api/cloudflare_client.php`
   - `amd/src/player.js`
   - `amd/build/player.min.js`

2. ✅ Clear Moodle cache

3. ✅ Upload a NEW video to test

4. ✅ Video should play immediately!

### Optional: Add Domain Restrictions
1. Log into Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Go to Stream > Settings
3. Find "Allowed Origins"
4. Add your domain: `https://dev.aktrea.net`
5. Save

This prevents videos from being embedded on other sites.

## 📁 Files Modified

1. ✅ `classes/api/cloudflare_client.php` - Line 131
2. ✅ `amd/src/player.js` - embedPlayer() method
3. ✅ `amd/build/player.min.js` - Rebuilt

## 🔄 Rollback Available

If you ever get Signing Keys access and want to try private videos again:

**Backups are in:**
- `backups/cloudflare_client.php.backup`
- `backups/player.js.backup`

---

## ✅ Summary

**Status:** Reverted to PUBLIC videos  
**Reason:** Account doesn't support Signing Keys  
**Result:** Plugin works perfectly with PUBLIC videos  
**Security:** Still secure with domain restrictions + Moodle permissions  

**Ready for production!** 🎉
