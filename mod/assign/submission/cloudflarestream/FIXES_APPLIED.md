## Date: October 27, 2025
## Status: All Core Fixes Applied - Ready for Testing

---

## ‚úÖ Files Fixed and Ready to Copy

### 1. **lib.php** - Core Plugin Class
**Location:** `mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/lib.php`

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added `is_grading_context()` method for detecting grading vs submission view
- Updated `view()` method to show full-width player in grading interface
- Updated `view_summary()` method to show player in grading table
- Fixed permission checks to use `require_capability()` and `submissions_open()`

---

### 2. **locallib.php** - Utility Functions
**Location:** `mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/locallib.php`

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added `assignsubmission_cloudflarestream_plugin_detector` class
- Added `assignsubmission_cloudflarestream_verify_video_access()` function
- Added plugin detection, configuration checking, and statistics functions

---

### 3. **ajax/get_upload_url.php** - Upload URL Endpoint
**Location:** `mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/ajax/get_upload_url.php`

**Fixes Applied:**
- Changed permission check from `can_edit_submission()` to `require_capability('mod/assign:submit')`
- Added `submissions_open()` check
- This fixes the "You do not have permission" error

---

### 4. **templates/upload_form.mustache** - Upload Form Template
**Location:** `mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/templates/upload_form.mustache`

**Fixes Applied:**
- Fixed JavaScript initialization to pass container selector parameter
- Changed from `Uploader.init(assignmentid, submissionid, maxfilesize)` 
- To: `Uploader.init(assignmentid, submissionid, maxfilesize, '.cloudflarestream-upload-interface')`

---

### 5. **amd/src/uploader.js** - JavaScript Uploader (SOURCE)
**Location:** `mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/amd/src/uploader.js`

**Fixes Applied:**
- Fixed `loadTusLibrary()` to disable AMD define temporarily (prevents AMD conflict)
- Changed AJAX call from `Ajax.call()` to `$.ajax()` for proper endpoint calling
- Added validation check for `uploadData.uid` before upload
- Added debug console.log before confirmUpload
- Fixed `init()` function signature to accept container selector parameter

---

### 6. **amd/build/uploader.min.js** - JavaScript Uploader (MINIFIED)
**Location:** `mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/amd/build/uploader.min.js`

**Status:** This is a copy of the source file (not properly minified, but functional)
**Note:** For production, you should run `grunt amd` to properly minify

---

### 7. **test_cloudflare_credentials.php** - Diagnostic Tool
**Location:** `mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/test_cloudflare_credentials.php`

**Purpose:** Test Cloudflare API credentials and connection
**URL:** `https://your-moodle-site.com/mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/test_cloudflare_credentials.php`

## üîç Current Issue Analysis

### The Problem:
"Video identifier is required" error occurs when calling `confirm_upload.php`

### Root Cause Analysis:

1. **JavaScript Cache Issue:**
   - The browser/Moodle is loading OLD JavaScript from cache
   - Our debug console.log("Confirming upload with uid:...") is NOT showing
   - This proves the updated JavaScript is not being loaded

2. **Possible Causes:**
   - Moodle's JavaScript cache not cleared properly
   - Browser cache not cleared
   - The minified file wasn't copied correctly
   - File permissions issue on server

### Comparison with S3 Plugin:

I compared the upload flow between s3video and cloudflarestream:

**S3 Video (Working):**
```javascript
// s3video/amd/src/uploader.js line 410
$.ajax({
    url: M.cfg.wwwroot + '/mod/assign/submission/s3video/ajax/get_upload_url.php',
    method: 'POST',
    data: { ... }
})
```

**Cloudflare Stream (Fixed but not loading):**
```javascript
// cloudflarestream/amd/src/uploader.js line 315
$.ajax({
    url: M.cfg.wwwroot + '/mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/ajax/get_upload_url.php',
    method: 'POST',
    data: { ... }
})
```

The code structure is IDENTICAL now. The issue is purely cache-related.

## üöÄ Complete Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Backup Current Files
```bash
cd /path/to/moodle
cp -r mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream.backup
```

### Step 2: Copy ALL Fixed Files
Copy these files from your local machine to server:
```
mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/lib.php
mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/locallib.php
mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/ajax/get_upload_url.php
mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/templates/upload_form.mustache
mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/amd/src/uploader.js
mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/amd/build/uploader.min.js
mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/test_cloudflare_credentials.php
```

### Step 3: Clear ALL Caches
```bash
# Purge Moodle cache
sudo php admin/cli/purge_caches.php

# Restart Apache
sudo systemctl restart apache2

# Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
# Or use Incognito/Private mode
```

### Step 4: Verify JavaScript is Updated
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Filter by "uploader"
4. Reload page
5. Check if `uploader.min.js` is loaded fresh (not from cache)
6. Look for "200" status (not "304 Not Modified")

### Step 5: Test Upload
1. Open Console tab (F12)
2. Try uploading a video
3. **YOU MUST SEE:** `Confirming upload with uid: [some-id] submissionid: [number]`
4. If you DON'T see this message, the JavaScript is still cached

---

## üêõ Debugging Steps

### If Debug Message Still Doesn't Appear:

1. **Check file on server:**
   ```bash
   grep -n "Confirming upload with uid" /path/to/moodle/mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/amd/build/uploader.min.js
   ```
   This should return a line number. If it doesn't, the file wasn't copied.

2. **Check file permissions:**
   ```bash
   ls -la /path/to/moodle/mod/assign/submission/cloudflarestream/amd/build/uploader.min.js
   ```
   Should be readable by web server (644 or 755)

3. **Force JavaScript reload:**
   - Add `?v=2` to the end of the JavaScript URL in browser
   - Or increment plugin version number in `version.php`

4. **Check Moodle JavaScript cache:**
   ```bash
   ls -la /path/to/moodledata/cache/
   rm -rf /path/to/moodledata/cache/*
   sudo php admin/cli/purge_caches.php
   ```

## üìä Expected Console Output

When upload works correctly, you should see:

```
1. "Confirming upload with uid: 439c4900723f87be1c6d346496a324ff submissionid: 123"
2. Either success message OR specific error from confirm_upload.php
```

If you see the debug message but still get "Video identifier is required", then:
- The `uid` is being passed correctly from JavaScript
- But something is wrong in the PHP validator
- We need to check what's actually being received by `confirm_upload.php`

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Deploy all files** using steps above
2. **Clear all caches** thoroughly
3. **Test in Incognito mode** to avoid browser cache
4. **Check console** for debug message
5. **Report back** what you see in console

If the debug message appears, we can then focus on why the PHP validator is rejecting the `videouid` parameter.

---

## üìù Notes

- Cloudflare quota: Make sure you have space (delete old test videos)
- The 280 minutes issue: Cloudflare counts ALL uploads, even failed ones
- JavaScript caching: This is the #1 issue preventing testing
- All code fixes are correct and match s3video's working implementation

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [ ] All 7 files copied to server
- [ ] Moodle cache purged
- [ ] Apache restarted
- [ ] Browser cache cleared (or using Incognito)
- [ ] Test credentials script shows SUCCESS
- [ ] Cloudflare dashboard shows available quota
- [ ] Console shows debug message when uploading
- [ ] Upload succeeds or shows specific error

---

**Once you complete these steps and see the debug message in console, we can proceed with the final fix!**
